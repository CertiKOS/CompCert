Uses gdb macros to step through a test program named main.c and dumps out state of all registers and memory operands at every step. Macros (a.k.a commands) are stored in gdb_init and are copied over to .gdbinit at compile-time.

To run: make smtrace
-Results are dumped to gdb.txt
-Static assembler instructions are objdumped to instrs.txt 

Note: If gdb.txt or instrs.txt doesn't exist, just run touch gdb.txt or touch instrs.txt then run make smtrace
